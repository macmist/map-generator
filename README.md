# Map generator in typescript

The goal of this project is to create a Random map generator for TTRPGs.
I'm exploring a lot of possibilities and putting things together as I go

At the moment, it computes a Voronoi Diagram, using the Fortune's algorithm.

Next steps are, in any order:

- [x] - Correctly generate Faces for the Diagram
- [x] - Randomly colorize the Voronoi diagram
- [x] - Add Lloyds relaxation
- [x] - Generate a random height map
- [x] - Apply the height map to the voronoi diagram
- [ ] - Experiment with other way to generate heightmap - Simplex? Diamond Square?
- [ ] - Better colouring
- [ ] - Add some rivers
- [ ] - Add biomes / cities
- [ ] - Better rendering
- [ ] - Export function
- [ ] - Get an online version
- [ ] - Get my stuff in move in the new world
- [ ] - Become the master of the new world
