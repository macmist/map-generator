# Map generator in typescript

The goal of this project is to create a Random map generator for TTRPGs.
I'm exploring a lot of possibilities and putting things together as I go

At the moment, it computes a Voronoi Diagram, using the Fortune's algorithm.

Next steps are, in any order:

- [x] - Correctly generate Faces for the Diagram
- [ ] - Randomly colorize the Voronoi diagram
- [ ] - Add Lloyds relaxation
- [ ] - Generate a random height map
- [ ] - Apply the height map to the voronoi diagram
